# Recipe-Webiste-


                        # INTRODUCTION
It is a Recipe Organization Website proposal. This website can access the standalone
package from any electronic device. The system helps in organizing the recipes on the website by
selecting the course, main ingredients, cuisine, adding tags and giving a star rating. Like - you will
select ingredients and then select time, then other options which will be interactive, from all those it
will provide a good matching recipe based on that to cook. I feel like it will be a good application to
have on smart fridges nowadays
Young tech-savvy professionals who work in the food industry or are part of the food
blogging community are the target audience. Thousands of recipes are available on the internet.
Many people use it instead of cookbooks; however, keeping track of recipes spread across fifty
different websites can be time-consuming and difficult.
