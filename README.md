# Recipe Webiste



# INTRODUCTION
It is a Recipe Organization Website proposal. This website can access the standalone
package from any electronic device. The system helps in organizing the recipes on the website by
selecting the course, main ingredients, cuisine, adding tags and giving a star rating. Like - you will
select ingredients and then select time, then other options which will be interactive, from all those it
will provide a good matching recipe based on that to cook. I feel like it will be a good application to
have on smart fridges nowadays
Young tech-savvy professionals who work in the food industry or are part of the food
blogging community are the target audience. Thousands of recipes are available on the internet.
Many people use it instead of cookbooks; however, keeping track of recipes spread across fifty
different websites can be time-consuming and difficult.


# OBJECTIVES
* Determining the design requirements to come you with a prototype for the identified module
* Developing an impeccable system to help recipe management in restaurants
* Create a website that will make recipe organization easier while also providing a satisfying
format and design


# BACKGROUND
There is a wide range of recipe management website available, with custom applications costing
significantly more. In my research, I concluded that a core set of features most websites offered
when trying to market their platform is based on functionality, look, or share of the market. The list
below shows the essential features.
* Generating lists of grocery
* Adjusting serving quantities
* Advancement of the search
* Email recipes
* Nutrition info
* Technical support
* Type in recipes by hand
* Printing recipes with or the cookbooks
* Cutting and pasting from web

While there are numerous recipe organization websites on the market, I could not locate the one
that was engineered explicitly for food bloggers. Instead, they are majorly aimed at the average
home cooks who wants to integrate a family recipe collection.
